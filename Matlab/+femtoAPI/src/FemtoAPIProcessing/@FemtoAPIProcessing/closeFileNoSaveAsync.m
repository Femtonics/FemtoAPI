function [ result ] = closeFileNoSaveAsync( obj, varargin )
%CLOSEFILENOSAVEASYNC Closes an already existing file without closing it.
%
% This function closes the file given by 'nodeDescriptor'.
% if the nodeDescriptor is sysntactically invalid, or no file with this
% node is opened on the server, this method gives an error message.
%
% If called without parameters, then the current file will be closed.
%
% It returns a struct that contains a command id, which can be used to
% monitor the asynchron file operation status (see getStatus() for
% details). The succeeded field is true means that the asynchronous command
% has been initated successfully. Otherwise, an error is returned.
%
% INPUTS [optional]:
%  fileHandle                integer number, unique descriptor (handle)
%                            of an open file in the server program.
%                            Default: current file
%
% OUTPUT:
%  result                struct that contains the following data:
%                          - id: (char array), the command id
%                          - succeeded: bool flag, means whether the synchronous
%                            part of the command ended successfully or not
% usage:
%   closeFileNoSaveAsync( obj, fileHandle ) -> closes with given
%   handle
%   or closeFileNoSaveAsync( obj ) -> closes current file
%
%  Examples:
%   obj.closeFileNoSaveAsync(43) -> closes file with handle 43, or gives
%   an error, if it does not exist
%
%   obj.closeFileNoSaveAsync() -> closes current file
%
%   See also closeFileAndSaveAsAsync()
