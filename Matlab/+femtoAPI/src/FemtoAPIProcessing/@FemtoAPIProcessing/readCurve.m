function [ curveData, curveInfo ] = readCurve( obj, unitHandle, curveIdx, varargin )
%READCURVE Reads curve data and curveInfo from the given measurement unit 
% Reads curve data and info as an 1x3 cell array, curveData{1} 
% and curveData{2} contain the 'X' and 'Y' curve data, and curveData{3}
% contains the curve metadata. 
%
% INPUTS: 
%  unitHandle               - unique measurement unit handle id, an 1xN 
%                             (or Nx1) vector in which the curve is located 
%  curveIdx                 - integer containing the curve index
% 
% INPUTS [optional]: 
%  vectorformat             - bool, if true, the RLE and equidistant curve 
%                             data is extracted to vectors. Default: false 
%
%  forceDouble              - bool, if true, the uint16 output data samples
%                             are converted to double samples. 
%                             Default: false
%
% OUTPUT: 
%  curveData                - a 1x3 cell array containing the 'X' and 'Y'
%                             curve data and curveInfo struct
% 
%  curveInfo                - struct, contains basic curve metainformation.  
%
%
% Example: 
%  Getting curve data from measurement unit [72,0,1] and curve idx 0: 
% 
%  curveData = femtoAPIObj.readCurve([72,0,1],0);
