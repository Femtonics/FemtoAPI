function curveMap = getCurves( obj, measurementHandle, channelType )
%GETCURVES Gets curve names and data for the given measurement unit 
% Returns a curve map with curve name as key and corresponding data as value 
% for the requested measurement unit and channel type (Input/output).
% If there is no curve for the selected channel type, an empty map is
% returned. 
% 
% Note: if the measurement contains lots of big curves, it can take long time 
% 
% INPUTS: 
%  measurementHandle         numeric array, handle of measurement unit,
%                            e.g. [23,0,0]

%  channelType               char array, type of channel to filter to, 
%                            must be 'Input' or 'Output'
%
% OUTPUT: 
%  curveMap                  map, contains curve name (key) and 
%                            corresponding curve data (values)
