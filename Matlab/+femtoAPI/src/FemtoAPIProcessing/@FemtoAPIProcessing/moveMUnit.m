function [result] = moveMUnit(obj, sourceMImageHandle, destMItemHandle)
%MOVEMUNIT Moves the source measurement image to the requested session/group.
% The destination session/group can be the same where the source image is,
% or in an other file.
% If the source or destination handle is invalid, or there is another
% file operation in progress on the files in question, an error is thrown.
% Channel contents are moved too.
%
% INPUTS [required]:
%  sourceMImageHandle       numeric array, source measurement image handle
%
%  destMItemHandle          numeric array, measurement session or group
%                           handle, where the source image to copy to
%
% OUTPUT:
%   result                  struct, it contains the following values:
%                            - id: (char array), the command id
%                            - succeeded: bool flag, means whether the
%                              synchronous part of the command ended
%                              successfully or not
%                            - movedMUnitIdx: handle of the new MUnit,
%                              where the source image is moved to
%
% Examples:
%  - move MUnit within the same session:
%    result = obj.moveMUnit([34,0,1], [34,0])
%
%  - move MUnit to another session (which can be in an other file, too):
%    result = obj.moveMUnit([34,0,1], [40,1])
