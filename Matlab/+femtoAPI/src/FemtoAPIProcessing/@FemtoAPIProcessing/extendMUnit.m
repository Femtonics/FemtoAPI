%EXTENDMUNIT Extends the given measurement unit with frames
% Extends the measurement unit given by 'mUnitHandle' with the specified

% It returns a struct that contains a command id, which can be used to
% monitor the asynchron file operation status (see getStatus() for
% details). The succeeded field is true means that the asynchronous command
% has been initated successfully. Otherwise, an error is returned.
%
% This command can fail, if the given measurement unit handle is invalid, 
% the image type is not extendable, or if an other asynchronous operation 
% is pending on the file.
