function [ result ] = closeFileAndSaveAsync( obj, varargin )
%CLOSEFILEANDSAVEASYNC Saves an already existing file then closes it.
% This function first saves file given by nodeDescriptor, then closes it. 
% If the nodeDescriptor is sysntactically invalid, or no file with this 
% node is opened on the server, this method gives an error message.
% If is not given, current file will be saved and closed. 
%
% If the file with the given node exists, but it is new, it will be not
% be saved, and an error message is returned. 
% It is possible to enable compression in file saving, by setting 
% compressFileIfPossible flag to true. By default, compression is
% disabled. 
%
% It returns a struct that contains a command id, which can be used to
% monitor the asynchron file operation status (see getStatus() for
% details). The succeeded field is true means that the asynchronous command
% has been initated successfully. Otherwise, an error is returned.
%
% INPUTS [OPTIONAL]: 
%  fileHandle                integer number, unique descriptor (handle) 
%                            of an open file in the server program. 
%                            Default: current file
%
%  compressFileIfPossible    bool, if true, server tries to compress the  
%                            file when saving if possible. Default: false 
%
% OUTPUT: 
%  result                struct that contains the following data:
%                          - id: (char array), the command id 
%                          - succeeded: bool flag, means whether the synchronous 
%                            part of the command ended successfully or not
%
% usage: 
%   closeFileAndSaveAsync( obj, nodeDescriptor, compressFileIfPossible )
%   or closeFileAndSaveAsync( obj, nodeDescriptor ) -> no compression
%   or closeFileAndSaveAsync( obj ) -> current file is closed and saved,
%   without compression
