function result = deleteMUnit(obj,mUniHandle)
%DELETEMUNIT Deletes a measurement unit from server program's GUI.
% Deletes measurement unit given by 'mUnitHandle'.
% It is an asynchronous operation.
% If the given input is in wrong format, or points to a non-existent
% measurement unit, or another asynchronous operation is pending on the file,
% it gives an error.
%
% INPUT:
%  mUnitHandle       numeric array, the measurement unit uniqe identifier
%                    (handle), e.g. [34,0,0]
%
% OUTPUT:
%   result           struct, it contains the following values:
%                     - id: (char array), the command id
%                     - succeeded: bool flag, means whether the synchronous
%                        part of the command ended successfully or not
%
% Example:
%  obj.deleteMUnit([23,0,0]);
