function result = addLastFrameToMSession(obj, destMSessionHandle, spaceName)
%ADDLASTFRAMETOMSESSION Adds measurement snap image to the given session.
% Creates a new measurement unit in the given measurement session, and adds
% the frame on the immediate window (last frame of a measurement/live or 
% snap) to it. Last frame is considered as the frame of immediate window 
% of the space given by 'spaceName', or from the default space if 
% 'spaceName' is empty. 
% 
% Note that this is a synchronous operation, which means that it waits until 
% the new measurement unit is created and the immediate image is added to
% it. 
% 
% INPUTS: 
%  destMSessionHandle           - vector, handle of the measurement session
%                                 which will contain the snap image in the 
%                                 added MUnit. If empty, current session is
%                                 considered. 
%
%  spaceName                    - char array, name of the space to add 
%                                 immediate image from. If empty, default 
%                                 space is considered.  
%
% OUTPUT: 
%  result                       - vector, handle of the created MUnit 
%                                 containing the immediate image.
