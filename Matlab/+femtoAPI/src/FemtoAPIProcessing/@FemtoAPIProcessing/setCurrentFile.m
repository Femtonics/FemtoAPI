%SETCURRENTFILE Sets the current file in the MESc GUI.
% Sets current file based on the file or measurement session handle. 
% The input parameter 'nodeDescriptor' must be a handle of an opened .mesc

% INPUT: 
%  nodeDescriptor      row/column numeric array, handle of an opened .mesc 
%                      file, or the last measurement session within a file

% OUTPUT: 
%  succeeded           true, if current file was successfully set
