function succeeded = modifyConversion(obj, conversionName, scale, offset, varargin)
%MODIFYCONVERSION Modifies linear conversion in conversion manager.
% Modifies the named linear conversion scale and offset on server, and
% saves it if requested. By default, it won't be saved on server, just
% modified. If the maed conversion is identity
%
% Note: scale and offset means the following in linear conversion:
% converted_value = scale * value + offset
%
% INPUTS [required]:
%  conversionName           char array, name of the conversion.
%  scale                    double, scale of linear conversion
%  offset                   double, offset of linear conversion
%
% INPUTS [optional]:
%  bSave                    bool, if true, saves the named conversion on
%                           server if it has been modified successfully,
%                           otherwise no saving is made. Default: false
%
% OUTPUT:
%  succeeded                true if the sent of the named conversion has
%                           been modified successfully, false otherwise
%
% Examples:
%  Modify conversion and save new values on server:
%   obj.modifyConversion('conv1', 10.1, 3.2, true)
%   obj.modifyConversion('conv1', 2, 3) -> will not be saved to disk on
%                                          server
