function [ succeeded ] = saveFileAsync( obj, varargin )
%SAVEFILEASYNC Saves file asynchronously.
% It saves file given by its node descriptor. The parameter nodeDescriptor  
% must be a valid measurement file handle, 
% session handle, or measurement handle, but in the latter case, it must be
% only the last measurement in that session. Otherwise this function 
% throws an error, and the file is not saved. 
% This function returns with true immediately after the save operation has
% been successfully started on the server. 
%
% INPUTS (optional):
%  nodeDescriptor          handle of an opened measurement file, session, or  
%                          the last measurement of a session. If not given,
%                          current measurement file is considered.
% OUTPUT: 
%  succeeded               true, if the save operation has been started
%                          successfully
%                          false otherwise
%
% usage: saveFileAsync(obj) or 
%        saveFileAsync(obj, nodeDescriptor)
%
% Examples: 
%  femtoapiObj.saveFileAsync()  -> saves current file
%  femtoapiObj.saveFileAsync(73)  -> saves file with handle 73
%  
% See also SAVEFILEASASYNC
