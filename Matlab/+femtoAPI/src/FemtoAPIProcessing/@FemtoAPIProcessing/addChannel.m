function [ result ] = addChannel( obj, nodeDescriptor, channelName )
%ADDCHANNEL Adds channel with spcified name to an existing measurement unit
% The nodeDescriptor must be an index of a valid, opened measurement unit
% on the server side, otherwise this function gives an error.
%
% INPUTS:
%   nodeDescriptor              measurement unit index, where channel will
%                               be added to, e.g. [54,0,1]
%
%   channelName                 name of the channel to be added, e.g. 'UG'
%
% OUTPUT:
%   result                struct that contains the following data:
%                          - addedChannelIdx: the concatenation of 'nodeDescriptor'
%                             and the the index of the new channel that has
%                             been added, e.g. [54,0,1,0]
%                          - id: (char array)
%                          - succeeded: synchronous part ended successfully
%
% Example:
%  If [54,0,1] is an index of an already opened measurement unit:
%  result = obj.addChannel([54,0,1],'UG')
