function result = openFilesAsync(obj,fileNames)
%OPENFILESASYNC Open files in the server program's GUI. 
% Open one or more files asynchronously in the server program.
% The full file path must be given as char array, separated with semicolon, 
% if more than one file wanted to be open.
%
% INPUT: 
%  fileNames          char array, full path to files to open, separated
%                     with ';'
%
% OUTPUT: 
%  result                struct that contains the following data:
%                          - id: (char array), the command id 
%                          - succeeded: bool flag, means whether the synchronous 
%                            part of the command ended successfully or not 
%
% Examples: 
%  obj.openFilesAsync('C:/file1.mesc;C:/file2.mesc');
%
%  obj.openFilesAsync({'C:/file1.mesc', 'C:/file2.mesc'});
%
