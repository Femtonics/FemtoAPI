classdef FemtoAPIIF < handle
    %FEMTOAPIIF Common interface for processing and acquisition classes.
    % It manages connection to the server and provides function to get
    % connection status.
    % Only one connection can be created, and it must be disconnected before
    % a descendant object is destroyed, or another connection wanted to be set.
    % If multiple instances of a descendant classes are created, the first created
    % object will create the connection, and the subsequent will not, and use
    % the same connection.
    % So you can create multiple instances of FemtoAPIProcessing and
    % FemtoAPIAcquistion objects to the same server, they will use the same
    % connection, which will be created when the first object is created.
