%GETACTIVETASKANDSUBTASK Gets the active task and sub task. 
% 
% This function uses the locally stored acquisition state, so it must be
% updated before calling this function.
%
% INPUTS [optional]: 
%  spaceName                   char array, name of the space. Default
%                              value: 'space1'
% OUTPUTS: 
%  activeTask                  the active measurement task, it can be
%                              'resonant' or 'galvo'
% 
%  activeSubTask               the selected measurement mode to the 
%                              active task, it can be 'timeSeries',
%                              'zStack' or 'volumeScan'
