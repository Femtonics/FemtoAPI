function [ succeeded ] = setImagingWindowParameters( obj, imagingParams )
%SETIMAGINGWINDOWPARAMETERS Sets imaging window parameters on server. 
% Sets imaging window parameters, which are the following: 
%   - imaging window size in X and Y direction,
%   - imaging window position ( given by "transformation" json object, 
%     in which the X and Y translation (from the origin) can be set)
%
% Restrictions:
%   - it sets viewport translation in X and Y directions, but not in Z 
%     direction.
%   - viewport rotation is not set
%
% Imaging parameters can be set per measurement type (resonant or galvo) 
% and space. The parameters must be within the limits (imaging window size
% and resolution limits, etc.), and if not, no changes are made at the server.
% Galvo and resonant imaging parameters can be set at a time, 
% but 'measurementType' and 'space' must be unique.
% 
%
% INPUT: 
%  imagingParams           struct, containing the imaging window
%                          parameters. 
%
% OUTPUT: 
%  succeeded               true, if the parameters are valid and changes
%                          are made on the server, false otherwise.
