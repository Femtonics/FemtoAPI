%SETZSTACKLASERINTENSITYPROFILE Sets Z-stack PMT/laser intensity profile
% Sets Z-stack depth intensity profile for the specified devices, measurement
% type and space on server.
%
% Requres a struct as input, which holds the values of PMT/laser intensity 
% devices at specific Z depths, given by 'firstZ', 'lastZ' and
% 'zStep'. Optionally, an intermediate position 'intermediateZ' can be given.  
% The 'DepthCorrection', which is a struct contains the device names and
% values at the specified 2 (or 3) points. 
% The specified z points - device value pairs are used as reference points,
% and at other depths (which are specified by the z step parameter), 
% device values are interpolated. 
% For detailed information and examples, see
