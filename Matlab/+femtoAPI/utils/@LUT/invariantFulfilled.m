function invariantFulfilled(obj)
%INVARIANTFULLFILLED Checks whether the LUT invariant is fullfilled.

% Can be used for checking the validity of the LUT object when some member
% values are modified. If the modified LUT object is invalid, then throws
% an appropriate error message, otherwise nothing happens.
% 
% Usage: 
%   lutObject.invariantFullfilled();
%   
%
