% example script on how to transform pixel coordinates to viewport coordinates 
% and import them into a pattern

input_file = 'coords.json';
handle = [99 0 0];
coords = pixelCoordsToViewport(handle, input_file);
centerPoints = coords.getViewportCoordinates'

% setCenterPoints function can be used to import viewport coordinates into a pattern
% it works for Point, Multiline, Chessboard and Multicube scans
patternIdx = 2;
DefaultAO.instance().scanPatterns.patterns(patternIdx).setCenterPoints(centerPoints);
