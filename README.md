# FemtoAPI - Analysis, programming tool, automation


## Programming Femtonics microscopes: FemtoAPI

The FemtoAPI (Application Programming Interface) enables you to access measurement data created with MES8 on FEMTO3D Atlas microscopes. It serves as a programmable client-server user interface to the Atlas software
and allows you to integrate a set of clearly defined instructions from various software systems, such as MATLAB or Python.
With the functions of FemtoAPI, you can create easily data visualization and analysis tools.
On the [FemtoAPI](https://femtonics.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/API2/pages/1448161743/FemtoAPI+2.0) page, you can find the detailed documentation of our tool.

- Use self-developed or other software tools for data analysis pipelines and offline data visualization with provided open-source wrapper functions.
- Open-source platform: write your code, share analysis tools, develop existing codes further, adapt your code to data acquired with their Femtonics microscopes.
  
- Remote control the Femtonics software from the comfort of the MATLAB IDE or your favorite Python IDE: keep accessing all the power of MATLAB and the Python ecosystem.

## Technical specifications of the FemtoAPI

  - Socket/network-based connection: data visualization or analysis can run on different workstations than the Femtonics softwares.
  - Open communication protocol: create new bindings easily.
  - Easy script creation: API functions closely refer to GUI buttons, parameter boxes, etc.
  - MATLAB and Python bindings.

## Prerequisites for using the FemtoAPI library
The FemtoAPI library depends on Qt, so it needs to be installed and added to the Windows PATH. The minimum Qt version required is Qt 5.15. Other tools are not needed.

## Femtonics supported by community analysis packages
For the annotation, downstream analysis, and curation of calcium imaging data recorded by [Femtonics microscopes](https://femtonics.eu/products/), we highly recommend the [Mesmerize package](https://github.com/kushalkolar/MESmerize) written by Kushal Kolar from the [Chatzigeorgiou Lab](https://www.chatzigeorgioulab.com/).
