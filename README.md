## Programming Femtonics microscopes: FemtoAPI

The FemtoAPI (Application Programming Interface) enables you to access measurement data created with MES8 on FEMTO3D Atlas microscopes. It serves as a programmable client-server user interface to the Atlas software
and allows you to integrate a set of clearly defined instructions from various software systems, such as MATLAB or Python.
With the functions of FemtoAPI, you can create easily data visualization and analysis tools.
On the [FemtoAPI](https://femtonics.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/API2/pages/1448161743/FemtoAPI+2.0) page, you can find the detailed documentation of our tool.

- Use self-developed or other software tools for data analysis pipelines and offline data visualization with provided open-source wrapper functions.
- Open-source platform: write your code, share analysis tools, develop existing codes further, adapt your code to data acquired with their Femtonics microscopes.
  
- Remote control the Femtonics software from the comfort of the MATLAB IDE or your favorite Python IDE: keep accessing all the power of MATLAB and the Python ecosystem.

## Technical specifications of the FemtoAPI

  - Socket/network-based connection: data visualization or analysis can run on different workstations than the Femtonics softwares.
  - Open communication protocol: create new bindings easily.
  - Easy script creation: API functions closely refer to GUI buttons, parameter boxes, etc.
  - MATLAB and Python bindings.

## Installation

### Prerequisites for using the FemtoAPI library
The FemtoAPI library depends on Qt, so it needs to be installed and added to the Windows PATH. The minimum Qt version required is Qt 5.15. Other tools are not needed.

## FemtoAPI libraries
In the open-source libraries, you can find a collection of the FemtoAPI functions.
There are some example/demo applications in both Python and Matlab folders.

### Technology types
According to the different Femtonics microscope technology types, there are several collections of API functions and examples, which you can find in the corresponding FemtoAPI Github branches.
On the current page, you can see information related to the Atlas system.
- [Atlas](https://github.com/Femtonics/FemtoAPI/tree/Atlas): The ```Atlas``` branch contains all the functions, that you can use when having a Femtonics Atlas system. It contains the FemtoAPI commands to use during processing measurement data.  
- [main](https://github.com/Femtonics/FemtoAPI/tree/main): Here you can find the full functionality of FemtoAPI. Contains both microscope control, and data processing related functions and examples.  

## Femtonics supported by community analysis packages
For the annotation, downstream analysis, and curation of calcium imaging data recorded by [Femtonics microscopes](https://femtonics.eu/products/), we highly recommend the [Mesmerize package](https://github.com/kushalkolar/MESmerize) written by Kushal Kolar from the [Chatzigeorgiou Lab](https://www.chatzigeorgioulab.com/).
