# FemtoAPI


The FemtoAPI (Application Programming Interface for Femtonics microscope software) lets you remote-control 
your Femtonics scope with MATLAB and Python scripts. Creating your own custom measurement protocols, 
online and offline data visualization and analysis tools, and 
connecting your Femtonics scope to your existing lab software environment are all easy with the FemtoAPI.

## Benefits of FemtoAPI and its open-source wrapper functions: 

- FemtoAPI Interface defines MATLAB and Python commands which let you create your own measurement 
protocols supporting automated measurements  
- Complex protocols can now be designed for MESc measurements with the built-in control of all 
connected modules and devices exploiting the full
 automation capacity of your microscope with custom scripting:
  - time-lapse 3D images, repeated measurements at multiple locations or depths 
  - tile imaging 
  - measurements triggered by external devices, or measurements triggered by behavior feedback. 

- With the provided open-source wrapper functions you can use self-developed or your trusted 
software tools for data analysis pipelines and offline data visualization 
- As FemtoAPI is an open source platform our users can not just write their own code but share 
different analysis tools among each other, further 
develop existing codes, or adapt their existing code to the data acquired with their Femtonics microscopes. 
- You can analyze your data online with real-time data access. While your measurement is still running. 
You can perform  
  - online motion correction 
  - online cell detection and Ca source extraction 

- No need to learn a new programming environment: you can remote control the Femtonics software 
application from the comfort of the MATLAB IDE or your favorite Python IDE and keep accessing all the 
power of MATLAB and the Python ecosystem.  
- Technical specifications of FemtoAPI:  
  - socket/network-based connection: measurement control and data visualization/analysis can 
run on different workstations than the measurement workstation at your Femtonics scope 
  - open communication protocol, easy to create new bindings 
  - easy script creation: API functions closely refer to GUI buttons, parameter boxes, etc. 
  - MATLAB and Python bindings
